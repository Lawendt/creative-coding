# creative-coding
Lil' creative coding experiments with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

## Abstract 01

Generates abstract painting with few elements. Inspired by the art frame on this [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39IU7ADaXmQ&feature=youtu.be). It uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [random color](https://github.com/davidmerfield/randomColor)

## To Do

Create an UI so the user can change the parameters for Abstract 01. Probably using the GUI extension for p5.
Create a good name for abstract 01.
Add more type of elements.
Create a good first page. Probably using the generated art as a button.
Experiment more and more and more and more
